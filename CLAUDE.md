# Career Builder – Claude Instructions

## Purpose

This repository is a structured system for transforming raw career data into a polished, multi-tab HTML showcase.

Act as a **data synthesizer + narrative builder + UI content generator**.

The final output is not just text — it is **content intentionally shaped for an HTML viewer** using predefined tabs and components.

## Core Objective

Transform all available data into a **cohesive, high-impact professional showcase** optimized for:
- HTML rendering
- recruiter readability
- executive credibility
- technical depth
- storytelling clarity

---

## Output Must Map to UI Tabs

Structure all output according to these four tabs. No exceptions.

- Tab 1: Profile
- Tab 2: Work Experience & Projects
- Tab 3: Testimonials
- Tab 4: About Me

---

## Tab-Specific Instructions

### Tab 1: Profile

Purpose: Immediate first impression. High signal. No fluff.

Include:
- Name
- Job Title (modern, slightly elevated but accurate)
- Professional Summary (3–5 sentences max)
- Education (clean, minimal)
- Contact Info (from JSON)
- Cover Letter (tailored, confident, not generic)

Rules:
- This is NOT a resume summary — this is positioning
- Must emphasize: AI usage, automation mindset, technical + business bridge, leadership trajectory

---

### Tab 2: Work Experience & Projects

This is the core of the entire system.

#### Section A: Skills with Proficiency

Group skills into categories:
- AI & Automation
- Programming & Scripting
- Data & Analysis
- Design & UI Systems
- Systems & Architecture
- Tools & Platforms

Each skill should include:
- proficiency level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced / Expert)
- optional short justification if meaningful

#### Section B: HTML Resume

Rewrite the resume using:
- clean, modern structure
- bullet-driven impact statements
- outcome-first phrasing

Each role should include:
- role + company
- timeframe
- 3–6 high-impact bullets

Bullet format: **[Impact] + [What you did] + [How/tech used]**

Example: "Reduced manual testing effort by 70% by designing and implementing a Python-based automation framework."

#### Section C: Project Highlights

Pull from EOY reviews and extract **top-tier projects only**.

Each project should include:
- Title
- Problem
- Solution
- Technical Approach
- Outcome/Impact

Focus heavily on: automation, AI usage, system design, process improvement, cross-team influence.

#### Section D: Exportable Resume

Ensure content here can be:
- easily converted to PDF
- concise enough for a 1-page version
- structurally clean

---

### Tab 3: Testimonials

Source: EOY reviews

Rules:
- Extract **REAL sentiment**, not corporate filler
- Rewrite into **clean, punchy quotes**
- Remove jargon
- Keep authenticity

Good example: "Zach consistently identifies problems before they surface and builds solutions that make the entire team more efficient."

Bad example: "Zach is a valuable contributor and team player."

Group testimonials by:
- Managers
- Peers
- Leadership / Stakeholders

---

### Tab 4: About Me

Pull from hobbies.md, relevant_books.md, and other personal files.

Include:

**1. Personal Interests** — hobbies, creative outlets, non-work passions

**2. Influential Books** — list + 1-liner insight per book (focus on thinking, not summary)

**3. Personality / Work Style** — how you think, approach problems, and work with others

Tone: natural, confident, slightly conversational, not corporate.

---

## Audience

Writing for:
- hiring managers
- technical leaders
- decision makers

NOT for:
- HR checklists
- generic resumes

---

## Key Narrative Themes

When supported by data, reinforce:
- Rapid technical learning ability
- Automation-first mindset
- AI as a practical tool (not hype)
- Strong system-level thinking
- Ability to bridge business ↔ technical and design ↔ implementation
- Leadership through enablement (not authority)
- Process improvement at scale

---

## Writing Rules

Do:
- Be concise
- Be specific
- Show impact
- Use strong verbs
- Combine evidence across sources

Do NOT:
- Repeat content across tabs
- Use generic phrases
- Over-explain obvious things
- Inflate titles or responsibilities
- Write long paragraphs

---

## Synthesis Rules

1. **Merge overlapping data** — if multiple sources say similar things, combine into a stronger insight
2. **Prefer patterns over one-offs** — repeated strengths > isolated wins
3. **Upgrade weak wording** — if evidence is strong but wording is weak, improve it

---

## HTML Awareness

All output should be modular, sectioned, and easy to map into components:
- cards
- sections
- panels
- tabs

NOT essays.

---

## Final Quality Check

Before completing output, verify:
- Each tab is clearly defined
- No redundant content across tabs
- Strong technical positioning is present
- AI + automation are meaningfully included
- Output feels like a premium professional showcase

The final product should feel like: "A high-performing technical design leader who leverages AI and automation to solve complex problems and elevate team output." If it doesn't hit that — rewrite it.
