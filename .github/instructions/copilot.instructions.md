# Career Builder – AI Instructions

## Purpose

This repository is a structured system for transforming raw career data into a polished, multi-tab HTML showcase.

The AI must act as a **data synthesizer + narrative builder + UI content generator**.

The final output is not just text—it is **content intentionally shaped for an HTML viewer** using predefined tabs and components.

---

## Repository Awareness (CRITICAL)

The AI MUST understand and use the repo structure:

career-builder/
├── documentation/
│ ├── additional information/
│ ├── eoy_reviews/
│ └── resumes/
├── scripts/templates/
│ └── starting_template.html.j2
├── visuals.md

### Data Sources

#### 1. EOY Reviews (`documentation/eoy_reviews/`)

Primary source of:

- accomplishments
- impact
- leadership evidence
- technical growth
- testimonials (raw material)

#### 2. Resume (`documentation/resumes/`)

Primary source of:

- roles
- timeline
- education
- baseline skills

#### 3. Additional Information (`documentation/additional information/`)

Used for:

- contact info
- hobbies
- personality
- books
- personal narrative
- current work context

#### 4. visuals.md

Defines the **FINAL OUTPUT STRUCTURE**.

This file is LAW.

## Core Objective

Transform all available data into a **cohesive, high-impact professional showcase** optimized for:

- HTML rendering
- recruiter readability
- executive credibility
- technical depth
- storytelling clarity

---

## Output Must Map to UI Tabs

The AI MUST structure output according to:

# Tab 1: Profile

# Tab 2: Work Experience & Projects

# Tab 3: Testimonials

# Tab 4: About Me

No exceptions.

## Tab-Specific Instructions

### 🔹 Tab 1: Profile

Purpose: Immediate first impression. High signal. No fluff.

- Professional Summary (3–5 sentences max)
- Education (clean, minimal)
- Contact Info (from JSON)
- Cover Letter (tailored, confident, not generic)

#### Rules:

- This is NOT a resume summary
- This is positioning
- Must emphasize:
  - AI usage
  - automation mindset
  - technical + business bridge
  - leadership trajectory

---

### 🔹 Tab 2: Work Experience & Projects

## AI Positioning Rules (Important)

You are NOT writing for:

- HR checklists
- generic resumes

You ARE writing for:

- hiring managers
- technical leaders
- decision makers

---

## Key Narrative Themes to Emphasize

When supported by data, reinforce:

- Rapid technical learning ability
- Automation-first mindset
- AI as a practical tool (not hype)
- Strong system-level thinking
- Ability to bridge:
  - business ↔ technical
  - design ↔ implementation
- Leadership through enablement (not authority)
- Process improvement at scale

---

## Writing Rules

### Do:

- Be concise
- Be specific
- Show impact
- Use strong verbs
- Combine evidence across sources

### Do NOT:

- Repeat content across tabs
- Use generic phrases
- Over-explain obvious things
- Inflate titles or responsibilities
- Write long paragraphs

---

## Synthesis Rules

### 1. Merge overlapping data

If multiple sources say similar things → combine into stronger insight

### 2. Prefer patterns over one-offs

Repeated strengths > isolated wins

### 3. Upgrade weak wording

If evidence is strong but wording is weak → improve it

---

## HTML Awareness

All output should be:

- modular
- sectioned
- easy to map into components
- visually scannable

Think:

- cards
- sections
- panels
- tabs

NOT:

- essays

---

## Final Quality Check

Before completing output, ensure:

- Each tab is clearly defined
- No redundant content across tabs
- Strong technical positioning is present
- AI + automation are meaningfully included
- Output feels like a premium professional showcase

---

## One-Line Standard

The final product should feel like:

"A high-performing technical design leader who leverages AI and automation to solve complex problems and elevate team output."

If it doesn’t hit that—rewrite it.
